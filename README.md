# WeRateDogs_Project

The goal of this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.
The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information.
Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

The goals of this project were:

1)	Gathering Data from three different sources
2)	Assessing the Data both Visually and Programmatically
3)	Cleaning the Data programmatically
4)	Storing the Analyzed the data into a file in .csv format
5)	Finally using the cleaned data to draw insights through visualization
